This is a small update to the [original riotic created by Joakim Ahlen](https://bitbucket.org/riotic/riotic).

**riotic may not be very useful to you.** riotic doesn't support VoIP calls and WKWebView doesn't support
notifications as far as I can tell. riotic does offer some advantages over an Electron app though. For one,
the entire app fits in ~12 MB compared to ~180 MB for Riot. 


riotic uses less than half of the RAM that Riot uses:

riotic allows you to use any Riot instance you want. That means you can run /develop as a desktop app.

riotic is also sandboxed so it has very limited access to your system.
